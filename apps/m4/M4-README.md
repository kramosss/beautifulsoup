# Milestone-4
## Technical Brief 

# With the previous API implementation BeautifulSoup objects could not be iterated over. In the new implementation it is made so that the BeauitfulSoup object itself can be iterated over. It does this by adding an iter method to  BeauitfulSoup and using the nodes generated by descendants in the descendants Tag property. The descendants property was already generating nodes for parsed trees in BeautifulSoup but now the iter method allows the BeautifulSoup object itself to be iterable.

# Build Script 

# For running the tests for the updated API
## Navigate into the test directory from the root directory 
```
cd bs4/tests
```
## Then run the current tests in test_replacer.py
``` 
pytest test_iterator.py -s
```
